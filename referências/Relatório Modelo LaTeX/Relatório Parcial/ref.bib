  abstract  = {The interest for short-reach links of the kind needed for inter-data-center communications has fueled in recent years the search for transmission schemes that are simultaneously highly performing and cost effective. In this work we propose a direct-detection coherent receiver that combines the advantages of coherent transmission and the cost-effectiveness of direct detection. The working principle of the proposed receiver is based on the famous Kramers--Kronig (KK) relations, and its implementation requires transmitting a continuous-wave signal at one edge of the information-carrying signal spectrum. The KK receiver scheme allows digital postcompensation of linear propagation impairments and, as compared to other existing solutions, is more efficient in terms of spectral occupancy and energy consumption.}

  abstract  = {Phase-retrieval (PR) receivers can reconstruct complex-valued signals using only direct detection without the use of any optical carriers. We propose and demonstrate two PR receiver solutions with faster and better convergence. First, we demonstrate a PR receiver based on parallel alternative projections that are produced by propagating the signal through an array of dispersive elements of increasing length followed by direct detection. Fast convergence and high retrieved phase accuracy are achieved using a modified Gerchbergâ€“Saxton (GS) algorithm that uses each projection as an intensity constraint. Second, we achieve similar performances employing an enhanced single projection GS algorithm with selective phase reset using symbol-wise GS errors. We experimentally reconstruct a 30 Gbaud QPSK signal after 55 km single-mode fiber transmission using the proposed solutions with a reduced number of iterations.},
